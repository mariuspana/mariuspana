A blog is an ideal way to get some ideas across, don't you think?

## Idealistul is all about:

* Technology, the open source kind mostly.
* Philosophy, what's left of it after the scientific revolution.
* Science, it works bitches!
* Entrepreneurship and business in general.
* Occasionally I may drop a rant or two for good measure.

Idealistul is the Romanian word for idealist in english. Yes, I do consider myself an idealist.
