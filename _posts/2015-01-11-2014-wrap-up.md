What a year we just wrapped up. 2014 was a great year for myself and [our company](http://www.sphs.ro). I realised (possibly rather late) that we live in an age where you can be in control of your technology and use it as a means to getting things done like never before. 2014 was also challenging for us (as a company) as we started developing our own solutions and moving from the so called value added reseller / system integrator into a product driven service provider role.

2014 saw us delve into new technology areas such as containerization, [complex application and infrastructure monitoring](http://www.sphs.ro/check_mk) and of course the development of our own products. I expect that in 2015 our efforts will pick up in the areas of containerization especially as we continue developing our products. New challenges such as launching our own public cloud service and helping our customers resolve their business issues will keep us focused throughout 2015. We have now at our disposal many tools to get the job done but more importantly the confidence that we can build that which is necessary ourselves if no tool presently exists.

I also expect that we will contribute more to the open source community as we ourselves rely on many great projects for our own services. Nanos gigantum humeris insidentes.

So what are these products I'm referring to? At present some are on the drawing table while a few are already in production in our office and at customers sites:

* kanban service desk

> At Spearhead we're all about high performance whether it be in computing or the way we get things done. We strive for efficiency and look at ways to constantly optimise our processes and procedures. The ideas of Lean IT resonate well within our company and so we set out to implement a system whereby we can increase operational output,the sharing of knowledge and reduce waste. We are well on our way through our own incident management solution based on the principles of Lean IT.

* kanban based CRM

Much like other companies we need sales. We need a way to keep a tab on our sales efforts, such as new lead generation, lead management and marketing campaigns and we expect to extend our service desk solution to include modules for sales activities as well. The Kanban board is a great visual tool for quickly identifying bottlenecks and we expect this to be an efficiency multiplier for our sales staff.


* IT monitoring

We have in our portfolio the best IT monitoring system, checkmk. We use this as a basis for keeping an eye on systems and getting relevant information when they are not behaving properly. It helps us move from a reactive stance to a more proactive one. This reduces many headaches and provides great insight for business decisions. 2015 will see us picking up efforts in our development for the checkmk monitoring system. We are getting our first plugins/checks uploaded to github as I write this.

* Continous integration & Automation
> 2014 saw the first fruits of our automation efforts. The results are outstanding and we will now focus a large portion of our support efforts into automating. We have chosen Ansible as our IT automation tool as it fits in very well with our existing tools but is also bar none the easiest to use. Furthermore we expect to integrate check_mk and ansible to automatically handle events generated by the monitoring core. To do this we first must "model" our systems and applications. The model wil be a recipe for what a server/system/application is supposed to do and the state it should be in. Any deviation from the model will be picked up by the monitoring core and fed back into ansible where it will be handled automatically and without any human intervention.

I was pleasantly surprised many times throughout 2014 at what our [small team](http://www.sphs.ro/meet-the-team) could achive. Our services are being used by many of the most prestigious companies around and this serves as confirmation that our values on using technology as a tool to get things done is also valued by our customers. I am looking forward to the challenges awaiting us in 2015 and am confident my team and I are ready for the next wave of awesome technologies and services that will continue to enable our clients to focus on their next challenges.
