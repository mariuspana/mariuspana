Throughout my career I have had help from many people some of whom I have never actually met in person. One person of special importance and one to whom I contribute quite a bit of my modest success to (at least peace of mind) is David Allen, the author of GTD.

in early 2004 when I launched my first company I got a first taste of stress and the feeling of being overwhelmed. Mind you I was still in my early 20's so stress was relatively new to me. Things however got progressively "worse" as I began taking on more work and by early 2005 I was down right overwhelmed with how many things needed to get done.

One of my clients recommended a book on personal productivity.  I am a skeptic by nature and had gone through many of the self-help books out there. I had and still have a very strong feeling that most of these books are more about getting you amped up temporarily but soon they fail on their promise. The book that was recommended was GTD and contrary to my first impression, that it is just another brainwashing self-help system, it turned out I could not have been farther from the truth.

Paul, the client who recommended GTD to me, had a palm pilot device and he showed me how he was using his email folders to store next actions. That moment was important for me because I was using email heavily and could easily relate since I was in the habit of storing to-do lists in mail folders. He showed me a few more tips and tricks and I decided to purchase the book for myself and give it a try.

I vividly remember thinking how this book would help make me more focused and organized. I got to the office the day that the book arrived and read the first two chapters before lunch. That evening I blew through another chapter and every evening I would spend time reading and organising. The following weekend I set aside the whole Saturday to get organized. My living room floor was full of all of my junk, books, papers and everything I had that was not where it should be.

That weekend changed the rest of my life. I put together my projects lists and contexts and started working away at organising all my "stuff". The most important thing however was not the organising but the visualizing of the desired outcome. I focused, dreamed and concentrated on what the end-result should be for each and every one of the items in my lists. It was nirvana and I had peace of mind and clarity like no other time I could remember in my life.

I have been using the GTD methodoly for 10 years now and it is undoubtedly the strongest weapon in my arsenal. It is the the single most important tool which I use daily both personally and professionally to get organised and stay on top of it all.
