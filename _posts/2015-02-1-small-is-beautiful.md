Small is beautiful was the slogan/motto for my first company, Spanning Media. It is also (I believe) on of the tenants in the Unix Philosophy.

That saying still resonates heavily with me today and I firmly believe that big is not always better and especially so with companies. We've heard a lot lately about companies splitting up, trying to become more nimble and more focused. These super corporations bring little value to society and they cost us the citizens more than we can imagine.

I believe we no longer need companies run by economists. We need engineers and scientists to deal with the real issues that the world is facing not financial engineering.

Search for consesus reports in your area and see how much small business contributes and compare that with the super corporations.

I am amazed at how little these super corporations give back to society. I am worried that they are deliberately damaging the earth and our society by solely focusing on profits. At the end of the day what should I expect from a for-profit company?

Watching HP break up and other large companies in my field of interest (Information Technology) I ponder how sustainable all of this is. Are we just building up a feeble card house? Time will tell, however I know with absolute certaintaty that quality and execellence is found mostly in the small and not the large.

The large need the small to continue growing as they rarely continue to create anything of value so they buy up to keep going all the while getting bloated along the way.

Lets do ourselves a favor, next time youre out and about, contribute some of your hard earned cash by purchasing from a local vendor, a family business, anything that is not part of the super corporation complex. Youll be doing us all a favor in the long-run.
