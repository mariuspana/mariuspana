We're live! I find it fitting that this first post I dedicate to the blogging platform [http://ghost.org](http://ghost.org). It is a beautifully elegant blogging platform built on nodejs.

While researching a blogging platform for this site I tried the following:

* pelican
* jekyll
* wordpress
* django
* textpattern

I finally decided on ghost due to the ease of use and very elegant interface. It is clear that the developers put some serious thought into the design. Using the software is a very pleasurable experience that helps you get focused on writing and creating content and not on tinkering with the software. I find it to be a very [GTD](http://gettingthingsdone.com) focused experience.

I do not think I can do a better job of describing the featues than the developers themselves so I encourage you to head on over to [http://ghost.org](http://ghost.org) and read some more about the features.

So what is wrong with any of the other alternatives you ask? Nothing really but:

* wordpress is now so much more than a blogging platform that I end up focusing on plugins, themes and other aspects.
* pelican is a great piece of software written in my favorite language (python) but I find that working locally with files and publishing them a bit too complex. Really the learning curve was a bit too much
* jekyll, I had heard many a great things abot jekyll so I thought I would try it out. I am not very familiar with ruby and was happy that I did not have delve deeply into ruby but in the end I dropped jekyll for the same reason as pelican
* django, now this was fun. I actually ended up writing almost a complete blogging system wich with django is fairly east and extremely fun. I ended up using the blog app in some other sites and dropped django as well as it seems a bit overkill. And also possibly due to the fact that I am not a designer and do not want to fiddle too much with html/css templates ...
* textpattern is also a great piece of software. I had used textpattern about 4 - 5 years ago and was impressed. To be honest at the end of my search I was just about to go with textpattern when I discovered ghost. I chose ghost as it simply rocks: the overall "feel" of the application just makes you want to write. It helped me get focused quickly without jumping through loops to get things set-up

I will follow-up with an article regarding installation of ghost on Centos 5.x as I was not able to use the [Ghost Guide](http://support.ghost.org/getting-started/) as seamlessy as portrayed in said guide. This may help others ...
