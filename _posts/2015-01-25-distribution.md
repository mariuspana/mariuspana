The channel is screwed. Meritocracy wins.

I am sure, as I have some MBA wearing friends, that you most likely think the distribution channel as understood by the marketing mix[](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marketing_mix) is necessary. While it may be in some fields in others it is a complete failure.

Im looking at it from an IT point of view so if we're talking about distribution of cereals this may not fit so well.

Distributors or value added distributors, VAD's as some may choose to call themselves, exist to provide a stock of hardware/software. Some even employ more technically oriented (pre-sales) people in order to help out their resellers in order to better understand and sell their products.

The reseller is the one who must actually know the products as he is usually the one making the sale. In a perfect distribution model the distributors have the stock on hand, have some pre-sales people ready to explain the products in more details and work through resellers who then make the sale and implement whatever services are necessary.

Needless to say it does not work like this where I live and my bet is it does not work so well in your neck of the woods.

Lets think about software distribution. Who in these glouriously digitals days would use distributors to sell their products when you could easily download them directly from the main developers/vendors site or at worst through the reseller who made the sale? There is a case to made for getting more exposure by using some of the distributors however I suggest you look for resellers and few of those at that. The reseller is the one making the sale or at least should be and you can apply the same targets and quotas to the reseller as you would to the distributor. Why not work directly with your resellers to set-up the marketing campaigns that you would have otherwise done with your distributor?

In hardware distribution maybe you can make a case that a distri is needed for stocks. I have rarely had any significant IT hardware order fullfilled locally, we always wait for the hardware to be shipped from China or some other location that is not in the dsitributors chain. The distributors knowledge is usually limited as well, you most likely end up working with the vendor to resolve any tough challenges anyway.

There may also be a case to me made if the distributor provides payment terms, transport, etc. in which case those risks are assumed by said distributor. I argue all of these terms can be laid directly on the reseller and you will have much better results.

As with anything in life make sure you choose the right reseller. Cutting out the middle man will do your product wonders if you have a solid team. In todays digital age you no longer need the classics of distribution to distribute your products. If its software then forget it alltogether, you can do it all yourself online (with the right marketing ideas). If your in hardware, give that extra margin to the one who is actually making the sale.

To those more business savyy Im talking level one marketing. Meritocracy is the credo around here and we dont need no stikin' middle men anymore.

Every distribution company I can think of at this point is also an integrator, selling directly to end-users. I am quite sure there is not one exception to this that I can think of.
