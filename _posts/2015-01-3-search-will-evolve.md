I currently take the cloud with a grain of salt. While at present I actively use [Microsoft Office365](http://office.microsoft.com/) there is not a day that goes by when I do not think about a better alternative, one that is open source (and open standards), completely integrated (none of this ridiculous and sloppy integration of Office, Exchange, Yammer, Sharepoint - which work together about as well as Bugs Bunny and Daffy Duck) and works on-premise.

I am not so worried about employees of the respective cloud company having access to my data. I also run hosting and pretty soon a public cloud infrastructure so I know the ethics and business processes that go into making sure these things do not happen. I am much more worried about the implied tracking of my search and now other data.

Microsoft with Office365 claims to not do such searches and they use this against google quite extensively so I have nothing to go on here except for their word which for lack of other evidence will have to do. So for the remainder of this rant my target is google which seems to be hellbent on being evil.

I am almost certain that [tracking you around](http://www.itworld.com/article/2832389/it-management/just-how-bad-is-online-tracking-.html) while you browse the web is bad because this information in the hands of the wrong people or marketers will be used against you. Marketeers love the information they can gather from your browsing habbits and patterns, this will continue to get more advanced and better targeting trackings and technologies will be developed so that you and I can be served exactly what we want when we want it. It sounds great but so far we've all been [filter bubbled](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filter_bubble) and if you are not completely aware of the marketing and filtering that is being applied you will have a difficult time. Much as we look now to poorer people and say they are unable to adapt to society so will we say to those who fall prey to filter bubbles where they are continously reinforcing bad or good ideas, depending on their past search histories. [Nothing new here](http://rootsaction.org/news-a-views/704-google-doing-evil-with-alec), this has all [been discussed](http://gizmodo.com/5878987/its-official-google-is-evil-now) and in much greater detail by smarter (if not more educated) [people](http://www.forbes.com/sites/rogerdooley/2013/10/28/google-evil-smart/).

I can now see something a bit more worrying. Your documents are fed into deep thinking machines to analyse every iota of data, to translate, simulate and correlate contacts, contract clauses, pricing, discounts, legal actions, the possibilities are limitless as to what can be scrutinized by these new algorightms. Imagine what someone with access to that information could do. Imagine the insights they could get from it and how they could use it against you.

The idea google would have us believe is that it is pushing for this information to be indexed, tossed around in all possible manners so that they can serve you ads and relevant ones at that. What happens when ads turn to particular government or individual interests? What happens when we think this information can provide us with information on the next flu outbreak? And what do you do when you realize that [it cannot](http://www.technologyreview.com/view/526416/mistaken-analysis/).

One solution I see is complete transparency. Google would have to provide a completely open and transparent solution that we can all look at and more importantly control. I highly doubt they will go this route so I sure hope some smart people put their heads together and begin working on some open source tools in this direction.

I believe in technology and the power of statistical analysis but I also believe in privacy and I do not have any with the majority of existing service providers much less google.

We need a "good as google" search engine that is open source. We need an ads business that is similar to googles, except that it is open and completely user controllable. We need the possibility to show search results and ads based on our past search histories but also a "raw" or non filtered option. We must avoid putting people in search bubbles.

How would one monetize these? Not sure yet, I personally would pay or donate to keep such a system operational. It can be done and should be done without haste.
