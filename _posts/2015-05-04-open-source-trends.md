In the past 3 years I've been battling my inner daemons in regards to Microsoft and their whole set-up. I love (yes, read it it aloud L-O-V-E, love) UNIX and the elegance it brings to computing so what the hell am I doing in Microsoft territory? Actually it is Microsoft who are trying desperately to cross into our domains and I as a conscious business man decided to look in their direction. A mistake that I have not taken lightly.

*"Companies exist to make money"*. What a horrible purpose to have in life. What a shallow understanding of life one must have to see things in this way. It is however the mantra that you will hear spouted by VC's, investors, your mom and so on. Yes, we build companies to make money and they should be commercially viable but there has to be a self-imposed limit to how much money and when that money making becomes the core objective and not a side-effect from building the best possible thing you could build.

I have seen this in companies I have ran in the past. We were building or delivering great services and got to the point to where we were looking to make more money than the previous quarter or year. *That* became the new objective of the company and not building and delivering great services.

I know many a sales men and investors are looking crosseyed at me but go ahead, laugh it off, I can take it. Those businesses soon failed because we had intelligent customers who could see the direction we were heading. Coincidentally those customers are still with me because I had the courage to say what was happening without coating it in sales/marketing B.S..

Now, Im all about making money but life is short, you've only got one shot (make no mistakes here) and you have to get it right. Making money is all fun and dandy but that is actually pretty easy because "There's a sucker born every minute" (-David Hannum). You'll have no shortage of gullible morons to fall for your [snake oil](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snake_oil). So it seems the difficult and challenging thing would be to build something that is sustainable and delivers a greater good.

We are starting to see a [new philosophy](http://osswatch.jiscinvolve.org/wp/2015/02/05/open-source-software-licensing-trends/) in business. It is based on the awesomeness of UNIX and the sharing of knowledge rather than hoarding and obstructing it. Look at any of the companies from the past 10 - 20 years (Yahoo, Facebook, Google), they're all open sourcing large portions of their once proprietary stacks. Many more smaller companies are doing (or should I say have been doing) this for decades. Contrast that to how many start-ups are using Microsoft technologies and you have to ask yourself why are so few start-ups using Microsoft stacks? Luckily this is asked frequently on [Quora](http://www.quora.com/search?q=microsoft+technologies).

The [trend](http://readwrite.com/2013/05/15/open-source-is-old-school-says-the-github-generation) seems to finally be kicking in the right direction and I believe we are seeing the death throws of the likes of IBM and Microsoft. Now I doubt they will die off soon (or completely for that matter), their pockets are deep,  their tenacity for doing shit is unfathomable and they have built around themselves incompetent managers in most companies so we can expect them to continue to thrive for a while longer. We can however look forward to an open source world where the best win and not the best at selling or marketing as has been the case in the not so distant past. We now need to educate our customers (and ourselves) to weed out these undesirables.
