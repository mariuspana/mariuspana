I finally got a chance to watch [The Unbelievers](http://unbelieversmovie.com) movie. I've been waiting for this opportunity for about a year and out of nowhere a friend dropped by with a DVD.

The Unbelievers' follows renowned scientists Richard Dawkins and Lawrence Krauss to some of their public speaking events as they fight for the importance of science and reason.

I urge you, dear friend, drop your old antiquated religious and political beliefs and study just a tiny bit of what science has brought to light. You will be changed for the better.

May the scales fall from you eyes.
