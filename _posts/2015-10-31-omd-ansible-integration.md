This year I was at the [2ND Check_MK Conference] (http://mathias-kettner.com/conference) in Munich, Germany. I've been toying around with the idea of self-healing and self-configuring systems for a while, mostly as a hobby. In the past few years however thanks to tools such as Ansible (and others) with a bit of effort you can build something that is very close to a self-healing and self-configuring system.

We're still waiting for the videos to be uploaded however in the meantime I've [uploaded] (https://github.com/spearheadsys/ansible-check_mk) what I used as a demo at the conference and hopefully this will give you an idea on how we couple automation with monitoring tools to provide what we call a self-configuring and self-healing IT infrastructure.

It's pretty early stuff however I've already seen and felt the potential of autonomic computing by the time that is freed from repetitive tasks such as installing and configuring operating systems and applications. All this will to enable us to focus on more innovative tasks that bring greater value.
