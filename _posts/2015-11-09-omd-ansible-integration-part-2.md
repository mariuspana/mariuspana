In my previous post I talked about [2ND Check_MK Conference](http://mathias-kettner.com/conference) in Munich, Germany. Since then the video and slides have been uploaded. You can find the video [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yGVJ2sgFwk) and the slides [here](http://mathias-kettner.com/download/2015-Konferenz-Ansible.pdf). There was also a live translation of the talks during the conference. You can find the German translation of the video [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U1ndRfCv7QU).

Let me know what you think.
