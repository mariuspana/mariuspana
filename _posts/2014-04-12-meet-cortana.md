This may come across as me dumping on the poor presenter and I really am not or at least that is not my intention, but!

I watched some of the BUILD conference and had a nice laugh at windows 8.1, the comeback of the start menu and Cortana the Microsoft Personal Assistant.

Here is something funny. Cortana actually gets to know you! She asks whats on your mind and below that she gives you suggestions for what you may be interested in. Is this not something [Siri does as well](http://www.apple.com/ios/siri/)? From Apple's page I found this quote "[And] Siri is proactive, so it will question you until it finds what youâ€™re looking for."

Ahh well, I like the way Microsoft is trying to reinvent itself but really, Cortana?

Now, on to the little man presenting. I have a difficult time believieng emo kids (or adults in this case) that can only see out of one eye because they gelled their hair straight over their other eye. Is this microsoft trying to reach out to the emos of the world? I actually think Microsoft is despreratly trying to reach the cool, new trendy kids (much as Apple has done) and got mixed up along the way. These guys wouldnt know cool if it hit them in the face with an iPad.

Microsoft, a devices and services company. They have deep pockets so they may very well pull this off but I can smell the corporate desperation.
