The new stable version of [check_mk](http://www.mathias-kettner.de), version 1.2.8, has been released. This new release has been in the works for over 14 months and has over 7500 git commits.

The Enterprise Edition has some very interesting additions such as:
- fully automatic agent updater
- cyclic/repeating downtimes
- graphical manager for extension packages
- a new system for calculating and visualizing metrics
- graphical designer for custom graphs


Check_MK now ships with over 1000 builtin and fully integrated plugins for all sorts of hardware/software and systems. 375 of these were added in 1.2.8 release. Many of the existing plugins have been extended or otherwise enhanced with this release.

The Hardware and Software Inventory system has also been extended and can now be used for switch port inventory which will make it much easier to identify unused ports.

As always installation packages are available for Debian, Ubuntu, SLES and Red Hat.

Upgrading your existing sites is as easy as always and well look into this very shortly.

Until then [check it out](http://www.mathias-kettner.de), it's getting better every day.
